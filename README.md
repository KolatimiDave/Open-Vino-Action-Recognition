# Open-Vino-Action-Recognition
This is a general-purpose action recognition composite model, consisting of encoder and decoder parts, trained on Kinetics-400 dataset. The encoder model uses Video Transformer approach with ResNet34 encoder.
Please refer to the kinetics [dataset](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/open-source-datasets/kinetics/) specification to see list of action that are recognised by this composite model.
